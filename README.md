Project Requirements:

Log Parsing:

Extract key pieces of information from each log entry, such as timestamp, log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG), and the message.

Filtering:

Provide options to filter the log entries by log level. For example, a user might be interested only in ERROR and WARN level messages.

Error and Warning Summary:

Summarize errors and warnings, providing counts and details for each type encountered in the log.

Event Tracking:

Track specific events, such as "System Startup Sequence Initiated" and "System health check OK", to ensure critical processes are starting and completing as expected.

Report Generation:

Generate a report summarizing the findings, including any trends identified in the error/warning logs and the status of system events.
